												"The arrows show the two types of interactions between the #yElemental #yDebuffs that occur when a card with the former #yDebuff's #yAffinity targets a creature with the latter #yDebuff. Blue-gray arrows signify #yCombusts. Brown arrows signify #yRedoxes. | Once per turn, you can click on an arrow to change its interaction type for the turn.",
												"#yCombusts and #yRedoxes grant #yReactions. #yCombusts provide a damage bonus to the card being played, while #yRedoxes provide a [Block] bonus to it. | Spend #yReactions by clicking on a #yDebuff's button to increase its #yLevel (signified by the blue number on each #yElemental #yDebuff). #yLevels increase a #yDebuff's passive effect as well as its #yCombust and #yRedox bonuses. Each #yLevel costs more than the last.",
